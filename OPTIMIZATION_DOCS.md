# Optimization Documentation Overview

The poker AI optimization documentation is organized into two complementary files:

---

## 📄 OPTIMIZATION_SUMMARY.md (Quick Reference)
**Size**: 7.2K | **Read Time**: 3-5 minutes

**Purpose**: Fast overview for users who want to quickly understand:
- Current performance metrics (4-6 sec/gen with Numba)
- What optimizations were implemented (11 total)
- Total speedup achieved (400-500×)
- Quick reference tables
- How to get maximum performance

**When to use**: 
- First-time readers
- Quick performance checks
- Reference for optimization names
- High-level understanding

---

## 📚 OPTIMIZATION_GUIDE.md (Complete Reference)
**Size**: 53K | **Read Time**: 30-45 minutes

**Purpose**: Comprehensive guide combining three detailed documents:

### Part 1: Optimization Status (18K)
- Complete optimization history timeline
- Detailed implementation descriptions
- Remaining optimization opportunities
- Learning impact analysis
- Recommended next steps

### Part 2: Numba JIT Implementation (27K)
- Complete JIT compilation guide
- Step-by-step implementation instructions
- Code examples and patterns
- Benchmarking procedures
- Troubleshooting guide
- Backward compatibility notes

### Part 3: Forward Batch Integration (7K)
- Batched inference implementation
- Technical details and code changes
- Performance analysis
- Integration testing

**When to use**:
- Implementing new optimizations
- Understanding existing optimizations in depth
- Troubleshooting performance issues
- Contributing to the codebase
- Extending optimization techniques
